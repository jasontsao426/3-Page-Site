              <p>The NBA salary cap is the limit to the total amount of money that National Basketball Association teams are allowed to pay their players. Like many professional sports leagues, the NBA has a salary cap to control costs and benefit parity, defined by the league's collective bargaining agreement (CBA). This limit is subject to a complex system of rules and exceptions and is calculated as a percentage of the league's revenue from the previous season. Under the CBA ratified in July 2017, the cap will continue to vary in future seasons based on league revenues. For the 2019–20 season, the cap is set at $109.14 million.</p>

            <div class = "contentContainers">
              <p>The NBA had a salary cap in the mid-1940s, but it was abolished after only one season. The league continued to operate without such a cap until 1984–85 season, when one was instituted in an attempt to level the playing field among all of the NBA's teams and ensure competitive balance for the League in the future. Under the new cap, they were each limited to   $3.6 million in total payroll. Under the 2005 CBA, salaries were capped at 57 percent of basketball-related income (BRI) and lasted for six years until June 30, 2011. The next CBA, which took effect in 2011, set the cap at 51.2 percent of BRI in 2011–12, with a 49-to-51 band in subsequent years. To ensure the players get their share of the BRI, teams are required to spend 90 percent of the salary cap each year, the salary cap for the 2019–20 season is $109.14 million (minimum team salary, which is set at 90 percent of the Salary Cap, is $98.226 million).</p>

              <h3>"There is so much uncertainty with the coronavirus pandemic, but one thing is for sure: the salary cap will be lowered, according to league sources."</h3>
                <p>Owners and players split Basketball Related Income (BRI) approximately 50-50. So far, owners have generally bore the brunt of coronavirus-caused financial pain. The salary cap is generally determined by projected revenue. But if players got paid too much (based on the approximate 50-50 split), the cap can be reduced the following season. </p>

              <p>The luxury tax generally rises and falls with the salary cap. A lower luxury-tax line could burden many teams and produce a tremendous advantage for the teams with lower payrolls. Those latter teams could extract sweeteners by trading for expensive players and/or receive relatively high distribution payments from tax teams</p>

              <p>A lower salary cap would particularly hurt players who signed max contract extensions last offseason – 76ers’ Ben Simmons, Nuggets’ Jamal Murray and Raptors’ Pascal Siakam. The max is based on a percentage of the salary cap. If the salary cap lands below $95,535,716, Celtics wing Jaylen Brown would also have his extension reduced.
                First-round picks also generally have their four-year contracts based on the salary cap the year they sign. So, the 2020 draft class could suffer. </p>

              <p>Free agents next offseason would also generally get squeezed. Some could opt for shorter contracts rather than locking into long-term deals with a relatively low starting salary. On the flip side, teams could get value with the risk-averse free agents who’d sign long-term under these conditions.</p>

            <p>LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are among NBA players who are reportedly refusing the NBA pay cuts during the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA is currently discussing ways to minimize the long-term losses which will be caused by the NBA suspension. LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are NBA players who have 'all you can get deals', which means that the players were to receive all or almost all of their salaries for the NBA 2019-20 season. </p>

            <p>The NBA is bound to the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with a force majeure clause, which can hold back player salaries for every cancelled NBA game. As per ESPN, the league and players unions are discussing withholding 25% from all players salaries in a league escrow in case the regular-season is cancelled. For each game, approximately 1.1% of the salary could be cut. For high-paid players like LeBron James, the loss per game could be more than $400,000. As the players receive their remaining paycheck after the season has ended, LeBron James and other players will have to pay the difference directly to the team. </p>
